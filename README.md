## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Collects form inputs and validates them
   - Stores them in an `expenses` array

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - Distributes cost fairly among payer and participants
   - Tracks net balances in a dictionary
   - Uses a greedy algorithm to determine settlement payments

3. **DOM Manipulation**:
   - Dynamically updates UI with expense items, balances, and summaries

4. **Export Handling**:
   - Generates downloadable CSV using Blob API
   - Uses `window.print()` for PDF
   - Generates WhatsApp-formatted message and copies to clipboard
